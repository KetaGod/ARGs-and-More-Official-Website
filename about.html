            <h2>About The Creator</h2>
            <p>I originally created this show just for myself as I'm always listening to podcasts while working since, to me at least,</p>
            <p>it seems to make the time go by quicker. So instead of just posting these for myself, I wanted to post them for more people</p>
            <p>that may share a similar mindset as I have! In the end, this show was created both for people who are working or are still in school</p>
            <p>and want something to listen to whilst they're doing their own schoolwork. I hope you enjoy whats on this page and if you have any</p>
            <p>any requests, concerns, or comments feel free to reach out to me! I will get back to you as soon as possible! -Keta</p>
